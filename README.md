# TradeMessageGenerator

## What is this shit ?

This is a javascript module made for NodeJS that create messages used for item trading in video games.

You provide the list of items you have to trade and what you want to get and it will generate a custom string that you can use in any markdown editor (like Discord) to show your friends what you have to trade.

It creates the message as a codeblock in css to have a monospaced font and colored text.
## ‚õì Installation:

Clone the repository in your project folder with the command
`git clone https://github.com/TheDiscorders/TradeMessageGenerator.git`
Place trade.js in your project folder

## üëå Usage:

```js
// Import the module
const trade = require("./TradeMessageGenerator/trade")

// Define your items
have = new trade.Have(["Fennec BP (No Paint)", "STRIKER INTERSTELLAR (BP)"])
want = new trade.Want(["200 Credits", "Offer"])
// Define the message that will be shown at the end of the message
message = "FIRM PRICES"

// Call the function
msg = trade.createMessage(have, want, message)

//Print result
console.log(msg)
```

That will return:

```css
----------------------[HAVE]----------------------{}----------------------[WANT]----------------------
                                                  {}                                                  
   [H] Fennec BP (No Paint)                       {}   [W] 200 Credits                       
   [H] STRIKER INTERSTELLAR (BP)                  {}   [W] Offer                                  
                                            FIRM PRICES
